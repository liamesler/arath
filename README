// Readme for Arath NPC Mod for BGII: SoA & ToB
// --------------------------------------------

Arath is a personal mod project for the game Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn and its expansion Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal. The aim of the mod is to add a new joinable NPC by the name of Arath Duskhelm, a True Neutral Druid. 


Name:
Arath Duskhelm

Race:
Human

Age:
24

Sex:
Male

Class:
Druid

Stats:
Str: 13 - natural strength
Dex: 11 - average 
Con: 13 - above average
Int: 13 - intelligent
Wis: 16 - has more insight into people and situations than one might initially think (plus -- important class stat)
Cha: 14 - attractive and personable
Total: 80

Personality:
Arath is a very complex, self-assured, humorous and hedonistic druid who cares for little else beyond himself and his love for nature. He loves the human form, both male and female, and isn't afraid to try to take what he wants -- though he's not always successful, much to his chagrin. He has a passionate hate for aberrations, the undead and anything else that falls beyond the natural scheme of things, and he has some rather complex and occasionally contradictory beliefs. 

Quest
Arath features a new quest in late SoA involving the slavers and the local Druid Grove.

Friendship
Arath will befriend any PC, and have a vast amount of interaction with him/her throughout SoA and ToB. The current plan is over 30 talks throughout.

Romance
He is available for a romantic relationship with a male or female PC with at least 12+ charisma, which starts out as a physical fling but over the course of SoA and ToB develops into something more (much to Arath's horror as an eternal bachelor).

Features
- an opinionated, quirky new Druid NPC
- many banters with BioWare NPCs (3+ throughout SoA/ToB)
- many talks on a variety of in-game plots and ideas
- commentary throughout the game on the PC's quest
- joins during the slaver line of quests in Chapter 2
- a new quest in late SoA
- a unique romance spanning SoA and ToB
- an extensive friendship with any PC not romancing him
- original portrait by Lady Lesatho
- original music by theacefes
- crossmod content with many popular mod NPCs
